  <h3>Project<br>Graphic Design 138<br>
    anggarah@vcu.edu<br>
    Monday<br>12:00 PM - 01:50 PM</h3>
  <div class="dropdown">
    <div class="accordion">Overview</div>
    <div class="accordionDrop">
      <p>Introduction to fundamental concepts in design theory and application. The Project explores the impact of syntactic relations in message making, and their influence on meaning. Introduces methods of analysis, assessment and manifesting a defined problem.<br><br>

        This Project class specifically investigates the experimentation of the web. Through HTML and CSS (and a little bit of JavaScript & jQuery), students will learn how to break the conformity of what "web design" is. What part of pre-existing user experience that we can alter through the alternative means of coding?

            <p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
            <div class="left">
              The departmental faculty have drafted a revised attendance policy, carefully considering the challenges and realities of holding classes in different spaces and in fractured time frames.<br><br>
              The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of times the class meets in one week. Our department has adopted a revised policy that addresses larger issues of
              expected engagement in a course. Consistent engagement is a vital component of successful completion of course objectives. The progression of this course requires all participants to be present and actively engaged in class, both during
              synchronous on-screen meetings, in person, and with asynchronous activities. Consistency of engagement is vital for successful completion of the course objectives. Each of us carries different circumstances and capacities; we are
              accountable for our own agency. This is always true, but especially crucial now. We are a community.<br><br>

              Be present for this class; participate consistently in the regular give-and-take of the classroom environment; be willing to share thoughts and experiences, as well as willing to actively listen to the thoughts and experiences of
              others.<br><br>

              Asynchronous engagement is equally important for your success in this course. If at any point during the semester you are unable to be present, communicate this clearly with me in a timely manner. Think about the manners in which you
              feel you will be able to be fully present and active with your community—this may differ from how others respond.<br><br>

              This class operates on the principle of charity, respect, and good faith. The responsibility to uphold and bolster these principles falls equally on all members of the class. Active listening is as important as active participation,
              please be gracious and generous with both. Connecting with peers is encouraged but does not substitute for communicating with the instructor directly. Contact me as soon as possible prior to, or after you miss a class. It is your
              responsibility to make-up for missing work.

            <p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>

            <div class="left">You will receive ongoing feedback on your work in group critiques and individual critiques with me. Projects and performance in this course will be evaluated with respect to three primary dimensions:<br><br>

              ⨁ <u>Participation:</u> your overall conduct throughout the duration of the project as you engage with the project and with your peers. Attendance, meeting deadlines, and being prepared for class will also be accounted for.<br>

              ⨁ <u>Process:</u> strength of your personal methodology and practice; idea generation and exploration; self evaluation; overall rigor in your approach to the project; articulation and presentation of your work; criticality.<br>

              ⨁ <u>Execution:</u> the quality of your ideas; craft; clarity of organization and presentation, how your materials (paper choice, imagery, typography, etc) connect to your concept.
